        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I’ve spent many hours hiking and climbing and camping. But to me, it has <span class="italic">never</span> been about the mountain. To me, it’s about discovering the world. It’s about the sights that take my breath away, and the experiences that expand my mind and soul. It’s about pushing the limits of human potential. On the mountain, adventure has meaning. When pitted against indomitable and unpredictable forces of nature, every move you make matters. Yet with enough perseverance and grit, climbing mountains can make a person better than they ever were.</p>

           <p>The yearning I feel to discover the world is why I study economics and psychology. It’s also why I love to travel. My relentless desire to summit tangible or metaphorical mountains is why I study strategic management- I want to take companies and people to heights that few have <span class="italic">ever</span> reached, pushing the limits of their potential, and making them better than they ever were.
